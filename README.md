# Golang

Is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable,and efficient software.

The purpose of this repository is to be able to understand and perform different golang exercises, so I can perform in different languages.

For this I use the Holberton methodology, which has helped me to understand low and high level languages.
